        <h2>Here are ten interesting facts about Amanda's unique life:</h2><br>
        <ol id="tribute-info">
            <li>Palmer was born Amanda MacKinnon Palmer in New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital, and grew up in
                Lexington, Massachusetts. Her parents divorced when she was one year old, and as a child she rarely saw
                her father.</li><br>
            <li>She attended Lexington High School, where she was involved in the drama department, and attended
                Wesleyan University where she was a member of the Eclectic Society. She staged performances based on
                work by the Legendary Pink Dots, an early influence, and was involved in the Legendary Pink Dots
                electronic mailing list, Cloud Zero. She then formed the Shadowbox Collective, devoted to street theatre
                and putting on theatrical shows,such as the 2002 play, Hotel Blanc, which she directed. </li><br>
            <li>With an interest in the performing arts, both in music and in theatre, Palmer spent time busking as a
                living statue called "The Eight Foot Bride" in Harvard Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Edinburgh,
                Scotland; Australia (where she met Jason Webley);[14] as well as many other locations. She refers to
                this line of work on The Dresden Dolls' self-titled CD, with the song "The Perfect Fit":</li><br>
            <li>At a Halloween party in 2000, Palmer met drummer Brian Viglione and afterwards they formed The Dresden Dolls. In an effort to expand the performance experience and interactivity, Palmer began inviting Lexington High School students to perform drama pieces at the Dresden Dolls' live shows. This evolved to The Dirty Business Brigade, a troupe of seasoned and new artists, performing at many gigs.</li><br>
            <li>In September 2007, Palmer collaborated with Jason Webley to launch the new project Evelyn Evelyn with the EP Elephant Elephant. In the project, the duo play conjoined twin sisters named Eva and Lyn, and through their music tell their fictional backstory.</li><br>
            <li>Her first solo studio album, Who Killed Amanda Palmer, was released on September 16, 2008. Ben Folds produced and also played on the album. The title is a play on an expression used by fans during Twin Peaks original run, "Who killed Laura Palmer?" A companion book of photos of Palmer looking as if she were murdered was released in July 2009. Titled Who Killed Amanda Palmer a Collection of Photographic Evidence, it featured photography by Kyle Cassidy and stories by Neil Gaiman, as well as lyrics from the album.[</li><br>
            <li>On April 20, 2012, Palmer announced on her blog that she launched a new album pre-order on Kickstarter. The Kickstarter project was ultimately supported by 24,883 backers for a grand total of $1,192,793 — at the time, the most funds ever raised for a musical project on Kickstarter. A widely reported and commented upon controversy emerged from the related tour when she asked for local musicians to volunteer to play with her for exposure, fun, beer, and hugs instead of money. She responded in the press and changed her policy to one of paying local musicians who volunteered to play with her on this tour. The album, Theatre Is Evil, was recorded with The Grand Theft Orchestra, produced by John Congleton, and released in September 2012. </li><br>
            <li>In November 2014, Palmer released her memoir, The Art of Asking (ISBN 1455581089), which expands on a Ted talk she gave in February 2013. The book made the NY Times bestsellers list. The book also received several critical reviews, most notably from NPR.</li><br>
            <li>She has identified as bisexual, telling afterellen.com in 2007: "I'm bisexual, but it's not the sort of thing I spent a lot of time thinking about," Palmer said. "I've slept with girls; I've slept with guys, so I guess that's what they call it! I'm not anti trying to use language to simplify our lives."Palmer has spoken out on feminist issues and about her open relationships, stating in one interview that "I've never been comfortable in a monogamous relationship in my life. I feel like I was built for open relationships just because of the way I function," Palmer explained. "It's not a reactive decision like, 'Hey I'm on the road, you're on the road, let's just find other people.' It was a fundamental building block of our relationship. We both like things this way."</li><br>
            <li>Neil Gaiman and Palmer confirmed their engagement in 2010 and Palmer hosted a flash mob wedding (not legally binding) for Gaiman's birthday in New Orleans later the same year. The couple legally married in a private ceremony in 2011. The wedding took place in the parlor of writers Ayelet Waldman and Michael Chabon. They have a son, Anthony "Ash", born on September 16, 2015.</li><br>

        <p>“There’s a difference between wanting to be looked at and wanting to be seen.

            When you are looked at, your eyes can be closed. You suck energy, you steal the spotlight. When you are seen, your eyes must be open, and you are seeing and recognizing your witness. You accept energy and you generate energy. You create light.
            
            One is exhibitionism, the other is connection.
            
            Not everybody wants to be looked at.
            
            Everybody wants to be seen.”</p><br>
